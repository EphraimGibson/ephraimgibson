# Hi there, I'm Ephraim 👋

I'm a passionate and driven developer focused on building impactful software solutions. I love turning complex ideas into clean, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🔭 Currently undertaking **Java Fundamentals** training with **EPAM Systems** to build a strong foundation in the language.
- 🌱 Actively learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java, while diving into **Cloud Computing** and infrastructure technologies.
- 🧠 Exploring **Full-Stack Development** and **AI systems**, always eager to deepen my knowledge.
- 💡 Looking to collaborate on **projects with real-world impact** — especially those involving tech and business crossover.

## 🤝 Let's Connect & Build

I'm not just a coder, I bring marketing and entrepreneurial energy to every project. If you have an idea and need a tech co-founder who can also think strategically, **let's team up**!
